## Welcome to my Page 🖐
### My name is Deniz Kosmaz 🤓
### and I am working towards becoming a Programmer, My Story:


I'm Deniz Kosmaz, 21 years old, with a clear goal—I aspire to become a programmer. In 2019, I completed my technical diploma in computer science, and as of December 2023, I've successfully concluded my training as an IT system management assistant.

During my apprenticeship, I realized the need to enhance my programming skills beyond the curriculum. Consequently, I took the initiative to teach myself various programming languages. While I've started with front-end development, I consider this just the beginning.

My ambition is to continually broaden my skills and explore diverse technologies. This journey is not just a personal endeavor but an invitation to future employers. I am eager to contribute my knowledge and passion for Data Scientist to an innovative team.
